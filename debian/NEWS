sensors-applet (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sensors-applet now loads sensor plugin modules from separate shared object
    files. Users of the NVIDIA plugin no longer have to rebuild the applet;
    they can now install the (forthcoming) sensors-applet-nvidia package from
    contrib.

sensors-applet (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The applet's configuration format changed again with this release, so you
    must again remove the applet from your panels and add a new instance of
    it.

sensors-applet (1.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sensors-applet now uses libsensors to detect sensors and obtain data from
    them. After upgrading, you should remove the applet from your GNOME panel
    and add it again; this will cause it to re-scan the system for sensors.
